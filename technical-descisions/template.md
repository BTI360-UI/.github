## Background

Are you replacing or improving a preexisting feature of your system? _(skip this section if no)_

* What technical decision are you replacing or improving?


<br/>

* What are the pain points of the current system?


<br/>

* Under what constraints was the previous technical decision made under?


<br/>

**Value proposition:** what value does implementing the decision create?


<br/>

**Stakeholders:** who will receive the value from the decision, and how?


<br/>

**Requirements:** what features must be achieved because of the decision?


<br/>

**Measurability:** how will you measure the success of the decision?


<br/>

**Limiting factors:** what constraints must be considered when making this decision?


<br/>

**Technical priority:** for which architectural principles are you optimizing? _(choose at most 3)_

## Evaluating the Options

**BTI360:** do any decisions directly align/misalign with BTI360 architectural patterns?


<br/>

**New information:** what needs to be researched to make a more informed decision?


<br/>

**Impact:** do any options have a notable worst-case scenario? Will your future self-hate you?


<br/>

**Agility:** do any options allow the ability to short circuit and pivot the decision?


<br/>

**Future responsibility:** for each option what are the future maintenance costs for your team?


<br/>

## Making a Decision

**Decision:** which option will you proceed with? Or will you delay the decision?


<br/>

**Consequences:** what are the consequences of the decision? Why did you make that decision?


<br/>

**Conclusion:** what is the main takeaway from this document? _(limit to a few sentences)_
